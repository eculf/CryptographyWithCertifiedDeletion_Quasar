    "So what is certified deletion and why is it important? To answer this question, suppose that Alice has written her will and would like to share her will with lawyer Bob, whom is going to store the will in a safebox. There are two scenarios to consider here:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li>Upon the unfortunate passing away of Alice, Bob would reveal the content of the will.</li>\n",
    "  <li>Prior to her passing, Alice chooses to invalidate her current will and requests that it be permanently deleted. While she may or may not revise the will's content, she wants Bob to furnish a valid certificate attesting to the proper deletion of her old will.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "If Alice decides to delete her will, how can Bob provide a certifcate such that it is verfiable by Alice that Bob has acted in an honest manner? As it turns out, classical information can be easily copied, and there is no guarantee that the information has been removed. However, thanks to quantum cryptography, one can provide a valid certificate of deletion upon request which can be verified. Note that in this context, Alice's will would either be revealed or deleted, but not both. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is just one application of certified deletion, which has many more use cases. Below, we provide a few additional examples:\n",
    "\n",
    " - <b>Confidential business information:</b> A company might want to share confidential information with a partner or investor, but only if certain conditions are met. For example, they might want to ensure that the information is not shared with competitors or used for unauthorized purposes. In this case, the company could encrypt the information and give the key to a trusted third party who will only release it if the partner or investor agrees to certain terms and conditions.: \n",
    " - <b>Classified information:</b> Government agencies and military organizations often use encryption to protect classified information. A trusted third party could hold the decryption key and only release it if certain conditions are met, such as a security breach or the need for a specific operation.\n",
    " \n",
    "As you can see, certified deletion has significant implications for privacy in various settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will provide an implementation of this idea with a small example. "

    "A post-quantum cryptosystem refers to cryptosystems that are cryptographically secure against an adversary even with quantum resources.

    "$\\text{Gen}$ refers to the key generation algorithm. The key generation algorithm Gen takes a security paramter $\\lambda$ as input and outputs a pair of keys $\\text{(pk, sk)}$. The security parameter $\\lambda$ is usually used to determine the length of the public and secret keys, as well as the number of random bits used by the encryption algorithm $\\text{Enc}$. The exact values of these parameters may depend on the specific encryption scheme and the desired level of security. The public key $\\text{pk}$ is used for encryption, while the secret key $\\text{sk}$ is used for decryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{Enc}$ is the encryption algorithm that takes as input a public key $\\text{pk}$, which is generated be $\\text{Gen}$, and a plaintext $m$ that we would like to encrypt. The output of this algorithm is a ciphertext, or the encrypted message, which is denoted by $\\text{ct}$. \n",

    "\n",
    "$\\text{CD-PKE}$ is the public-key encryption scheme with certified deletion, which takes as input $\\text{(Gen, Enc', Dec', Del, Ver)}$. As we we will see, this encryption scheme is using the encyprtion scheme $\\text{PKE(Gen, Enc, Dec)}$ as a foundational component.\n",

The output of $\\text{Dec}$ is yet another tuple $(\\theta, b')$. \n",

    "\n",
    "$\\text{Del}$ is the deletion algorithm, which like $\\text{Dec'}$, takes the ciphertext as an input. However, instead of measuring $|x\\rangle_\\theta$ in $\\theta$-basis, it would measure $|x\\rangle_\\theta$ in the Hadamard basis. We denote the output of the measurement $x'$ and $\\text{Del}$ outputs a certificate $\\text{cert}$, which is assigned to be $x'$. \n",

    "$\\text{Ver}$ is the verification algorithm that takes as input a verification key $\\text{vk}$ which contains an ordered pair $(x, \\theta)$ and a certficate $\\text{cert}=x'$. If $\\theta_i = 1$, then we check if $x_i = x_i'$. If this condition is satified whenever $\\theta_i=1$, then the verification algorithm outputs $\\text{T}$, implying that the certificate has been verified. If there exists at least one $i$, such that $x_i \\neq x_i'$ when $\\theta_i = 1$, then the algorithm returns $\\bot$, which implies that the certificate is not valid. "

    "The security of this certified deletion encryption is based on the uncertainty principle. This is a fundamental property of quantum systems, stating that there are measurements that are incompatible. That is, if you measure an observable, you lose information about the measurement result of a different observable. In this case, since we are working with qubit spaces, the two relevant measurements are measurement in the computational and Hadamard bases. The quantum ciphertext is composed of a list of qubits prepared in either the computational or Hadamard bases. In order to decrypt, we need the information encoded in the Hadamard basis qubits, whose measurement destroys the information encoded in the computational basis qubits. Conversely, to certify deletion, we need the information encoded in the computational basis qubits, which makes it impossible to decrypt the message correctly.\n",

    "To conclude, we were able to show that there is a feasible implementation of public key certified-deletion encryption. Since this uses few qubits and no entanglement, it is something that can be run on near-term devices. Further developments to this encryption include introducing error-correction to allow it to be run more effectively on a noisy device; and instantiating it with a homomorphic encryption scheme to allow for computation with the encrypted data."
